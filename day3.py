# Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.
# Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.
# e.g. 86 is even because 86 ÷ 2 = 43
# 43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.
# e.g. 59 is odd because 59 ÷ 2 = 29.5
# 29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.
# The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division.
# e.g.
# 6 ÷ 2 = 3 with no remainder.
# therefore: 6 % 2 = 0
# 5 ÷ 2 = 2 x 2 + 1, remainder is 1.
# therefore: 5 % 2 = 1
# 14 ÷ 4 = 3 x 4 + 2, remainder is 2.
# therefore: 14 % 4 = 2

# Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

# Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
# Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
# Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
# Above 35 they are clinically obese.
